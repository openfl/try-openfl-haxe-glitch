# Try OpenFL

This is a Haxe sandbox for trying [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org). Hit the "Remix" button in order to begin making changes!

The entry point is "src/App.hx"

Glitch will boot a virtual machine to run your code -- this may take a moment, but then pressing "Show" will a live preview.

Changes to your code will save and compile automatically! The live preview will also refresh. If there are errors, open the debug console in the live preview window and they will appear there.

You can also try another sandbox:
